<!--
NORMAL:
Use two foreach loops to create a master array of all 52 cards in the array $deck, each represented as a key value pair in the format ‘face of suit’, 
use the print_r function to print out the contents of the $deck to make sure it is correct.
EX: “King of Spades” should be one of the elements of the array and it should have a value of 13.
